## Pool Settings

### About mining regions 

There is network delay when users connecting miners to different nodes in different area. Selecting the nearest nodes can provide the most stable connection.

### Set alert event 

Set the trigger conditions and user will get notifications once miners run unstably.

### Set watchers 

Setting watchers can let multiple managers access the same account Simultaneously.

### Register a VIP address

The VIP address is separate, independent, stable and hidden, protecting users from attacks. 

### Click  “settings” button on top right of the website, you can modify your account and address as follows:

## What is Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the mainstream cryptocurrency around the world, which can be generated by large number of calculations. People call this process mining. Once the miner (mining machine) calculate the qualifying result, it would get Bitcoin as a reward.


### What is Bitcoin wallet？

Bitcoin wallet is the software managing bitcoin address, in which user could receive, send and store the Bitcoin.

### How to get a Bitcoin wallet 

Users can download Mulitbit wallet on its official website(multibit.org).

### What is Bitcoin address？

Bitcoin address (for example: 18AN9XojYq5EU5x8p6pgdYk3RKo6zu9xzy) consists of a string of characters and numbers. Just like others send the email to you, he can send Bitcoin to you via your Bitcoin address.

### What is Bitcoin private key?

It’s the string of characters and numbers that unlock the corresponding Bitcoin address, such as `5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh`.

### How to keep Bitcoin address safely？

Use the backup feature of Bitcoin wallet or keep your private key printed in a safe place.

### What is Bitcoin transaction? How to make the transaction？

General speaking, Bitcoin transaction is the process sending Bitcoin from one address to another. Open your wallet, fill in the target address(some wallet supports scaning QR code), send the Bitcoin and the transaction will be done.

### Why does Bitcoin transaction take time to wait for confirmations？

When a transaction is included in a block, it could be said there is one confirmation. After this block, with each new one is generated, the number of confirmation will plus one. Once the number reaches 6 and more, the transaction is generally considered safe and irreversible.

### What’s blockchain?

Blockchain likes an open ledger, which records all transactions since the birth of Bitcoin. Anyone can download and check this blockchain. A block corresponds to a page on this ledger.

### What is mining a block？

According to Bitcoin protocol, every block is generated every 10 minutes roughly. During these time, workers, who complete the computing tasks will get about 12.5 Bitcoin as a reward. This process is called mining a block.

### Who does Bitcoin transaction fee pay to？

Bitcoin traders need to pay a transaction fee to the workers mining the block. Workers package the transaction, which is equivalent to recording it in the ledger.

### Why is the fluctuation of Bitcoin price so significant？

Similar to the traditional gold, silver and other precious metals, the price is influenced by many factors, such as the political situation, market acceptance and so on. But currently the price is usually higher than bitcoin mining costs, so that the mining process is still profitable.

### What’s the condition to mine Bitcoin？

Large-scale mining needs special field with good ventilation, moderate temperature and humidity , stable and affordable electricity, administrators understanding Bitcoin, as well as technical man proficient in maintenance of power line and network.

### How to purchase bitcoin miners 

Access Bitmain official website (www.bitmain.com) and purchase the latest Antminers.

## FAQ

### Why don’t I receive the activation email?

Maybe the email is blocked into the trash, or maybe it’s shielded by some related keywords, which requires you to confirm your mailbox settings.

### How to mine on BTC Pool/ How to connect the miners to BTC Pool/ How to add the sub-account?

Login the background system of miners, fill in the miner name (the password could be blank) and save the profile. The miners will be added to BTC Pool in a few seconds.

Miner name settings: sub-account.001, sub-account.002, etc; each miner name corresponds to a miner.

### How to login the background system of miners？

Type the IP address of miners into the address bar with a web browser under the local area network. The default account is: username ‘root’, password ‘root’.

### How to fill in the password of miners？

The password is recommended to be blank because only a few mining pools now require users to fill in the password.

### How to fill in the payment address on BTC Pool？

Login the BTC Pool website, click ‘Settings’ to enter the settings page, then click ‘Edit’ button of the corresponding sub-account and fill in the payment address.

### What’s lucky figure？

There is a certain probability to mine a block, sometimes faster sometimes slower. The lucky figure fluctuate around the theoretical value (100%). When the lucky figure is higher, earnings will be higher too, which only affects those selecting PPLNS.

### Why will the earnings get less every two weeks？

As the network difficulty ascends every two weeks, it’s normal to get less earnings slightly under the same hash rate.

### What’s API？

API stands for ‘Application Programming Interface’, which can be used for technical man to access the status of BTC Pool and miners.

### What are the rejected shares？

The rejected shares are the number of shares rejected by BTC Pool due to the unstable network and other factors. The rejection rate is the proportion of the rejected shares number accounted for the total submitted number. The smaller the rate, the higher the efficiency.

### Why is total earnings not equal to the account balance？

Because the PPS mode needs to charge 1.5% fee.

### How to configure the difficulty of miners？

![](http://news-img-s.btc.com/images/201611/de2bf6261cf914320be73faa6676b7d0.2546x1252.jpg)

If your miners are extremely high or low, configuring a suitable difficulty will improve the efficiency.

Difficulty parameters: d=4096 or d=4096, md=1024. Type these parameters into your password bar in the miner background system.

"d=4096" means that the initial difficulty will be 4096 after its connection. "md=1024" means that the miner's minimum difficulty is 1024. No matter how low the hashrate is, the pool will never assign a difficulty less than 1024.

In command line, it's:

* cgminer -o stratum+tcp://cn.ss.btc.com:3333 -u USER_NAME -p d=4096 ...

* cgminer -o stratum+tcp://cn.ss.btc.com:3333 -u USER_NAME -p d=4096,md=1024 ...

Recommended difficulty can be calculated as: D=H*2.3, H is the hashrate, G is unit.

E.g:

* S9 is 14T, then D = 14000 * 2.3 = 32200, set to d=32200

* S7 is 5T, then D = 5000 * 2.3 = 11500, set to d=11500

* U3 is 50G, then D = 50 * 2.3 = 115, set to d=115

### Why does the hash rate of miners fluctuate?
It’s normal. The calculating process of miners is not a stable output and it’s expected to get the average hash rate and earnings. Besides, the status of miners, working environment and unstable of network and other factors would affect the hash rate, too. To keep stable earnings, the administrators working in a mining field have to check out all the related factors.

### What's Namecoin? How to receive it when BTC pool gives away Namecoin every day?

Namecoin is an altcoin, which improves decentralization, security, censorship resistance, privacy, and speed of certain components of the Internet infrastructure such as DNS and identities.

Users can sign up on BTC-e and Poloniex exchange and get the Namecoin address.


### What's the difference between the subsidy address and the default address?

The default address is to receive the mining earnings every day. And BTC pool will give away bitcoin subsidy when we have preferential policy, and users should fill in subsidy address to receive it. If subsidy address is not filled in, the subsidy will be sent to the default address.

### What is PPS 

There is a certain probability factor to mine and sometimes earnings will be lower than the average. Under the PPS mode, you can get 100% of the expected earnings with the subsidies provided by BTC pool. That is, when your miner is connected to BTC pool, your earnings will be directly based on the contribution regardless of luck figure.

### About mining fee and Tx fee 

When users mine on BTC pool, they should pay mining fee to BTC pool. When users send a transaction to others via bitcoin, they should pay transaction fee to workers.
