            "<p >What is Bitcoin?</p>
              <div>Bitcoin is the mainstream cryptocurrency around the world, which can be generated by large number of calculations. People call this process mining. Once the miner (mining machine) calculate the qualifying result, it would get Bitcoin as a reward.</div>
              <p >What is Bitcoin wallet？</p>
              <div>Bitcoin wallet is the software managing bitcoin address, in which user could receive, send and store the Bitcoin.</div>
              <p >What is Bitcoin address？</p>
              <div>Bitcoin address (for example: 18AN9XojYq5EU5x8p6pgdYk3RKo6zu9xzy) consists of a string of characters and numbers. Just like others send the email to you, he can send Bitcoin to you via your Bitcoin address.</div>
              <p >What is Bitcoin private key?</p>
              <div>It’s the string of characters and numbers that unlock the corresponding Bitcoin address, such as 5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh.</div>
              <p >How to keep Bitcoin address safely？</p>
              <div>Use the backup feature of Bitcoin wallet or keep your private key printed in a safe place.</div>
              <p >What is Bitcoin transaction? How to make the transaction？</p>
              <div>General speaking, Bitcoin transaction is the process sending Bitcoin from one address to another. Open your wallet, fill in the target address(some wallet supports scaning QR code), send the Bitcoin and the transaction will be done.</div>
              <p >Why does Bitcoin transaction take time to wait for confirmations？</p>
              <div>When a transaction is included in a block, it could be said there is one confirmation. After this block, with each new one is generated, the number of confirmation will plus one. Once the number reaches 6 and more, the transaction is generally considered safe and irreversible.</div>
              <p >What’s blockchain?</p>
              <div>Blockchain likes an open ledger, which records all transactions since the birth of Bitcoin. Anyone can download and check this blockchain. A block corresponds to a page on this ledger.</div>
              <p >What is mining a block？</p>
              <div>According to Bitcoin protocol, every block is generated every 10 minutes roughly. During these time, workers, who complete the computing tasks will get about 12.5 Bitcoin as a reward. This process is called mining a block.</div>
              <p >Who does Bitcoin transaction fee pay to？</p>
              <div>Bitcoin traders need to pay a transaction fee to the workers mining the block. Workers package the transaction, which is equivalent to recording it in the ledger.</div>
              <p >Why is the fluctuation of Bitcoin price so significant？</p>
              <div>Similar to the traditional gold, silver and other precious metals, the price is influenced by many factors, such as the political situation, market acceptance and so on. But currently the price is usually higher than bitcoin mining costs, so that the mining process is still profitable.</div>
              <p >What’s the condition to mine Bitcoin？</p>
              <div>Large-scale mining needs special field with good ventilation, moderate temperature and humidity , stable and affordable electricity, administrators understanding Bitcoin, as well as technical man proficient in maintenance of power line and network.</div>

        'faqEx' =>
            " <p >Why don’t I receive the activation email?</p>
              <div>Maybe the email is blocked into the trash, or maybe it’s shielded by some related keywords, which requires you to confirm your mailbox settings.</div>
              <p>How to mine on BTC Pool/ How to connect the miners to BTC Pool/ How to add the sub-account?</p>
              <div>Login the background system of miners, fill in the miner name (the password could be blank) and save the profile. The miners will be added to BTC Pool in a few seconds.Miner name settings: sub-account.001, sub-account.002, etc; each name corresponds to a miner.</div>
              <div>Miner ID settings: sub-account.001, sub-account.002, etc; each miner ID corresponds to a miner.</div>
              <p >How to login the background system of miners？</p>
              <div>Type the IP address of miners into the address bar with a web browser under the local area network. The default account is: username ‘root’, password ‘root’.</div>
              <p >How to fill in the password of miners？</p>
              <div>The password is recommended to be blank because only a few mining pools now require users to fill in the password.</div>
              <p >How to fill in the payment address on BTC Pool？</p>
              <div>Login the BTC Pool website, click ‘Settings’ to enter the settings page, then click ‘Edit’ button of the corresponding sub-account and fill in the payment address.</div>
              <p >What’s lucky figure？</p>
              <div>There is a certain probability to mine a block, sometimes faster sometimes slower. The lucky figure fluctuate around the theoretical value (100%). When the lucky figure is higher, earnings will be higher too, which only affects those selecting PPLNS.</div>
              <p >Why will the earnings get less every two weeks？</p>
              <div>As the network difficulty ascends every two weeks, it’s normal to get less earnings slightly under the same hash rate.</div>
              <p >What’s API？</p>
              <div>API stands for ‘Application Programming Interface’, which can be used for technical man to access the status of BTC Pool and miners.</div>
              <p >What are the rejected shares？</p>
              <div>he rejected shares are the number of shares rejected by BTC Pool because those shares don't meet the requirement of servers. The rejection rate is the proportion of the rejected shares number accounted for the total submitted number. The smaller the rate, the higher the efficiency.</div>
              <p >Why is total earnings not equal to the account balance？</p>
              <div>Because the PPS mode needs to charge 1.5% fee.</div>
